# Projects from CS162 OSU

A list of projects from CS 162 covering:
* Design and implement programs that require multiple classes and structures hierarchies of classes that uses inheritance and polymorphism
an understanding of abstraction, modularity and separation of concerns. <br>
* Construct and use basic linear structures (arrays, stacks, queues, and various linked lists) in programs, and be able to describe instances appropriate for their use. <br>
* Classify moderately complicated algorithms in these complexity classes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n2). <br>
* Develop test-data sets and testing plans for programming projects. <br>
* Produce recursive algorithms, and choose appropriately between iterative and recursive algorithms.
